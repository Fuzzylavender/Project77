    <p>What is Visual Studio Code and how do you set it up?</p>
    <p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. </p>
    <p>Setting up VS Code:</p>
    <p>1. Download and Install </p>
    <p>2. Create a new file </p>
    <p>3. See an overview of the UI </p>
    <p>4. Install support for your favorite programming language. </p>

    <p> What is a console screen, how is it used, how do you open it, and how do you print something on it?</p>
    <p>A console is an interface. You can use it to interact with the user and to access and understand errors. If you right click and press inspect, in the top leftish middlish corner you will see a tab called console. Click that. In your HTML code, but a console.log() function in it, and whatever you put in the parantheses will be displayed. </p>  
    <p>Go to your Console.</p>
    <p>First, I will merge I am Yashasree with Sinha. If a=25, and b=64, I will add, subtract, multiply and divide these two numbers, along with finding the square root of each.</p>
    <script>
        console.log("My First Console Project!")
        first =  "I am Yashasree"
        last = " Sinha"
        full = first.concat(last)
        console.log(full)
        a = 25;
        b = 64;
        add = a + b;
        minus = b - a;
        multiply = a * b;
        divide = b / a;
        console.log(add)
        console.log(minus)
        console.log(multiply)
        console.log(divide)
        console.log(Math.sqrt(a))
        console.log(Math.sqrt(b))
    </script>
